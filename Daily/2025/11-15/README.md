This is really easy, So when I start I think the answer is about the cookie.<br>

*about cookie*: cookie is the data save on the web, the web side can use cookie to know who you are, and show what you need.<br>

I open the Network and saw the cookie. <br>
But we don't know what is the flag.<br>
back to our talk, the cookie is the data, they maybe is like: <br>
*user:blabalbal*<br>

so I think this is encode, so that's why we don't understand<br>

If this is cipher, I think it's probably is the base64,Because we can see the number(67), small latter(a), capital letter(A) and some special symbols(=)<br>

and we found the flag :D!
